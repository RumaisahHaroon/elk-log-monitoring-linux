# 🛡️ Centralized Log Monitoring on Linux using ELK Stack & Filebeat

This project demonstrates how to set up centralized log monitoring using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) along with Filebeat on a Linux system. All services are containerized using Docker.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Elasticsearch
- Logstash
- Kibana
- Filebeat
- Ubuntu Linux

## 📦 Project Structure
-  project report
- `docker-compose` – to spin up ELK stack services
- `logstash` – defines the Logstash pipeline
- `filebeat.yml` – configures Filebeat to collect `/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/auth.log`
- Setup-instructions.md


## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrate Packetbeat for network monitoring
- Set up alerting using Watcher or third-party tools
